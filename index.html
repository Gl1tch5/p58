      <p>I like building with Lego bricks because you can make almost anything with them. They also let you be as creative as you want in how you use them in your builds. In my free time I like to build things using Lego bricks. I have built many things such as a model of london, a model of the eiffel tower, a castle, an 8-bit game console (that doesn't work), and a spaceship. There are tons of different types of Lego sets like Lego city, Lego creator, Lego classic, and Lego technic.
